# IoT-BASED-SMART-CHAIR-USING-RASPBERRY-PI
â€”The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of 
physical objects "things" embedded with sensors, software, and 
other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging 
data with other devices and systems via the internet. This project 
enables us to assess a seated person's posture in real time and 
improve sitting posture. Long-term sitting harms the spine and 
causes chronic problems that require long-term therapy. People 
who are sick have a significant impact on office productivity. Long 
periods of sitting while studying cause major postural and spinal 
problems in young people. Our motivation is to assist people in 
paying attention to their health and proper sitting . Maintaining 
good posture by sitting with a straight back and shoulders not only 
enhances physical well-being but also enhances confidence and 
productivity through the development of healthy habits and 
frequent breaks. To make the chair smart, we use an IoT system 
with sensors, processing power, and software, with the goal of 
eventually assisting humans in maintaining good posture and 
healthy habits. Making a regular chair into a smart chair using 
Raspberry Pi, which will continuously detect your sitting posture 
and send a notification if it is incorrect. Two FSR sensors will be 
fitted onto the backrest of the chair to detect the inclination of the 
chair. The backrest sensor will detect if the person is sitting 
straight or not. The humidity and temperature sensor module 
inside the cushion of the seat will detect the temperature and 
pressure of the user. The goal of this project is to maintain proper 
posture for improved health and longevity.
